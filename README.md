## OVERVIEW OF PROBLEM STATEMENT
### DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM
According to a survey by the American Foundation for Auto Traffic Safety, fatigued drivers account for up to 21 percent of traffic fatalities in the United States. To decline this proportion, Lots of researchers have focused on detecting fatigue driving in the past few decades, the latest progress includes active detection methods and passive detection methods. Among these methods, we are attracted by the active detection method based on facial features and driver posture. We want to use them as reference in combination with the AIoT.
### OVERVIEW OF SOLUTION PROBLEM
We are going to build a IoT-based Smart Driver Monitor System(DMS) to monitor the degree of fatigue by collecting multimodal sensor and camera data and transporting the data through the IoT system, using the AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and train the model, giving reminders and warnings of fatigued driving through fronted applications so that the drivers can keep a sober mind and proper driving posture. We believe that DMS can fulfilling an important role in safe driving. In organisational context level, DMS can reduce the incidence of traffic accidents in the whole society. In consumer level, DMS would be the guarantee of driving safety.

## Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

To run the project: python Driver Drowsiness Detection.py   

For environment: pip install -r Requirements.txt

## Heart_rate_detection
original data in dir data

processed data in dir processed_data

combined final data in dir processed_final_data

main.py is the file for training K-means model

predict.py is the file for using K-means model to predict

other files are used for processing data

kmeans_model.pkl is the trained model
## weather_based_detection
TBC

## posture_based_analysis

To obtain the training and testing data, run unzip state-farm-distracted-driver-detection in data dir

The trained data is stored in saved_model dir

main.py is used for training data 

prediction.py is used for prediction

To apply the model in application, you need to some changes in prediction of the function form and file name.

### MQTT
#### Why we use MQTT?
* MQTT is a publish-subscribe model which is ideal for one-to-many messaging

* MQTT is an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. So it is ideal for IoT System messaging.

* The MQTT broker is responsible for receiving all messages and sending them to the subscribed clients. So it is idel for extracting, filtering, enriching, and transforming data for further processing
#### Basic settings
MQTT Broker: EMQX in a dedicated cloud environment for business
MQTT Clients: 
Raspberry Pi
ESP32
Laptop used for AL and ML

#### EMQX rule engine
Rules were created for transmitting datas to SQL.

#### Database: MySQL
We deployed a mysql database on a free AliCloud server and connected it to emqx's RULE ENGINE, which allows the mqtt broker to listen for messages on topics and store them in a corresponding table in the database for further processing.

#### MJPG—Streamer
In order to display face video images and detect them as smoothly as possible in real time, we choose to deploy mjpeg streamer on Raspberry Pi, which directly calls the camera to obtain mjpeg for processing, and at the same time calls the html, css and js files to be published on the specified port for network access.
